# TIL

> Today I Learned

Inspired by [Swyx's blog post](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) I created this repository to share my notes about programming in gereral.

If you find any mistake of typo feel free to let me know.

## Usage

After creating a new entry, run `./createReadme.py > README.md` to regenerate
the readme with the new data.

If you are using git, you can install this script as a pre-commit git hook so
that it is autogenerated on each commit.  Use the following command:
    cd .git/hooks/ && ln -s ../../createReadme.py pre-commit && cd -


## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
[jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) who claims to have stolen
it from others.
